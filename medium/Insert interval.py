Problem Statement #
Given a list of non-overlapping intervals sorted by their start time,
insert a given interval at the correct position and merge all necessary
intervals to produce a list that has only mutually exclusive intervals.

Example 1:

Input: Intervals=[[1,3], [5,7], [8,12]], New Interval=[4,6]
Output: [[1,3], [4,7], [8,12]]
Explanation: After insertion, since [4,6] overlaps with [5,7],
 we merged them into one [4,7].
Example 2:

Input: Intervals=[[1,3], [5,7], [8,12]], New Interval=[4,10]
Output: [[1,3], [4,12]]
Explanation: After insertion, since [4,10] overlaps with [5,7] & [8,12],
we merged them into [4,12].
Example 3:

Input: Intervals=[[2,3],[5,7]], New Interval=[1,4]
Output: [[1,4], [5,7]]
Explanation: After insertion, since [1,4] overlaps with [2,3],
we merged them into one [1,4].

"""
Given the head of a Singly LinkedList, write a method to
check if the LinkedList is a palindrome or not.

Your algorithm should use constant space and the input
LinkedList should be in the original form once the algorithm
is finished. The algorithm should have
O
(
N
)
O(N) time complexity where ‘N’ is the number of nodes in the LinkedList.

Example 1:

Input: 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 4 -> 2 -> null
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 4 -> 2 -> 2 -> null
Output: false
